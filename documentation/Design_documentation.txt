Design Overview
Project Purpose

This project is a full-stack AI-powered web application designed to help students summarize and organize study notes efficiently. It combines a modern front-end interface with a Flask backend and integrates Google’s Gemini API for natural language processing.

The system was developed iteratively, progressing from version 1.1 to version 2, with each version improving structure, maintainability, and real-world applicability.

System Architecture Overview

The application follows a client–server architecture:

Frontend

Built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript

Handles user interaction, UI rendering, and API requests

Backend

Built with Flask (Python)

Manages API endpoints, business logic, and data flow

AI Layer

Google Gemini API

Responsible for summarization and conversational responses

Version 1.1 Design
Overview

Version 1.1 focuses on delivering core functionality with a straightforward implementation.

Characteristics

Direct API calls from the frontend to the Flask backend

Minimal separation between UI logic and application logic

Basic state handling on the client side

Strengths

Simple and easy to understand

Faster development time

Effective proof of concept

Limitations

Harder to scale as features increase

Some tightly coupled logic between UI and data handling

Limited extensibility for advanced features

Version 2 Design
Overview

Version 2 emphasizes clean architecture and scalability, while remaining appropriate for a student project.

Improvements

Better separation of frontend logic and backend responsibilities

More organized JavaScript structure for state management

Cleaner Flask routes with clearer responsibilities

Improved API request and response handling

Trade-offs

Slightly more complex than v1.1

Requires better understanding of frontend–backend communication

Still under evaluation to avoid unnecessary overengineering

Backend Design
Flask Responsibilities

Handle note summarization requests

Communicate securely with the Gemini API

Manage saved notes, tags, and chat interactions

Validate input and return structured JSON responses

API Endpoints (High-Level)

/api/summarize – Sends notes or uploaded files to Gemini for summarization

/api/notes – Create, retrieve, filter, and delete notes

/api/tags – Manage note categorization

/api/notes/<id>/chat – Context-aware AI chat based on saved notes

Design Decision Summary
Aspect	Version 1.1	Version 2
Architecture	Basic	More structured
Scalability	Limited	Improved
Maintainability	Moderate	High
Learning Focus	Fundamentals	Real-world practices

Version 1.1 serves as a functional baseline, while version 2 aims to reflect industry-style design decisions in a manageable way for a student developer.

Text input and file upload support

Tag-based note organization

Search and filter functionality

Context-aware chat with saved notes

Modern and responsive UI

Technologies Used
Frontend

HTML

Tailwind CSS

JavaScript

Backend

Python

Flask

AI Integration

Google Gemini API

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

Create and activate a virtual environment

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable

Run the Flask application

flask run


Open the application in your browser

Versioning

v1.1 – Functional prototype with core features

v2 – Improved structure, scalability, and maintainability

Both versions are retained to demonstrate design evolution and learning progress.

Limitations

No authentication system

Intended for educational use

AI responses depend on external API availability

Future Improvements

User authentication and accounts

Database optimization

Rate limiting and API error handling

Deployment to a cloud platform

Author

Developed as a student full-stack project to explore AI integration, Flask backend development, and modern front-end design.
